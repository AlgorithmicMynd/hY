# Blockchain-Based Quizzes DApp on Aptos

## Project Vision
The *Blockchain-Based Quizzes DApp* is a decentralized platform that allows users to participate in quizzes and earn *tokens* for answering questions correctly. The project aims to incentivize learning by providing rewards in the form of tokens stored on the *Aptos blockchain. The **React* frontend enables users to access quizzes, track their scores, and claim rewards, while the *Petra wallet* facilitates secure transactions and token management.

## Features
- *Earn Tokens for Correct Answers*: Users can earn tokens by answering quiz questions correctly.
- *Decentralized Token Rewards*: Rewards are issued as tokens on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- *React Frontend*: Modern, intuitive interface for accessing and answering quizzes.
- *Aptos Move Smart Contracts*: Secure management of quiz logic and token issuance using the Aptos Move language.
- *Petra Wallet Integration*: Petra wallet allows users to authenticate and manage their tokens.

## Tech Stack
- *Frontend*: React.js
- *Blockchain*: Aptos (Move Language)
- *Wallet*: Petra Wallet

## How It Works
1. *Participate in Quizzes*: Users answer multiple-choice quiz questions on the platform.
2. *Earn Tokens*: Correct answers reward users with tokens stored on the Aptos blockchain.
3. *Claim Rewards*: Tokens can be claimed and managed using the Petra wallet.
4. *Blockchain Security*: Quiz results and token rewards are securely managed by smart contracts on Aptos.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/)
- [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aptos-blockchain-quizzes.git
   cd aptos-blockchain-quizzes
   

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   bash
   npm install
   

3. Set up the Aptos environment:
   - Install Aptos CLI:  
     bash
     curl -sSf https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/install | sh
     
   - Create an Aptos account:
     bash
     aptos init
     
   - Fund the account using the Aptos faucet (Devnet):
     bash
     aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_account_address
     

4. Deploy the Move smart contract:
   - Navigate to the move folder in your project.
   - Build and deploy the contract:
     bash
     aptos move compile
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     

5. Run the React frontend:
   bash
   npm start
   

6. Ensure *Petra Wallet* is installed and connected to interact with the DApp.

### Deployment

1. *Deploy on Aptos Devnet/Testnet*:
   - *Build the Move contract*:
     bash
     aptos move compile
     
   - *Deploy the contract*:
     bash
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     
   - The contract will be deployed on Aptos Devnet/Testnet. Make sure to copy the contract address for frontend integration.
   
2. *Frontend Deployment*:
   - Deploy the React app using any preferred service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   - Update the contract address and Aptos network configurations in the frontend code.

### Usage
- Go to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or deployed link).
- Connect your *Petra Wallet*.
- Participate in quizzes and answer questions to earn tokens as rewards.

## Aptos CLI Commands
- *Check account balance*:
  bash
  aptos account balance --profile devnet
  
- *Deploy Move contract*:
  bash
  aptos move publish --profile devnet
  
- *Fund account with Devnet faucet*:
  bash
  aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_account_address
